# "Tolk vs FunC" gas benchmarks

This repository demonstrates how real smart contracts look in **Tolk** â€” and how efficient they can be.

I took several standard contracts from the TON ecosystem (Jetton, NFT, Wallet, etc.) and migrated them **from FunC to Tolk**:
- preserving the original logic and behavior,
- **passing the same test suites** as the FunC versions,
- but written in **idiomatic, expressive Tolk style**,
- with **significantly reduced gas costs**.

**The goal is to show that Tolk can replace FunC** not just in theory â€” but in production, today.

## How does Tolk achieve these numbers?

#### 1. Language design and type system

Tolk code is closer to business logic â€” and still maps cleanly to the TVM's stack model.

This is not "compiler magic" â€” it's a result of language design. Just writing straightforward code is often more efficient than manual stack juggling in FunC.

For instance, universal `createMessage`, based on unions, is more lightweight than hand-crafted message cell composition. It also handles `StateInit` and deployment without creating extra cells.

#### 2. The `lazy` keyword

The compiler decides when and where to load data from slices. It enables:
- prefix-based lazy matching without creating unions on a stack,
- loading only the fields you actually use,
- skipping over unused fields or references,
- computing immutable sub-slices for serializing back.

#### 3. Optimizing compiler

Inlining, constant condition folding, grouping of sequential `storeInt`, peephole optimizations, stack reordering â€” all applied automatically.

#### 4. TVM-11 instructions

They allow accessing incoming message data without parsing `msg_cell` â€” but contribute only ~25% of the savings.
Most of the gain comes from the language itself.

#### 5. Fixing inefficiencies in original FunC code

In some cases, the FunC versions had suboptimal logic. The Tolk versions improve it â€” while preserving behavior.


## Not just about gas â€” readability comes first

Tolk is built for **readability**. These contracts aren't "just cleaner" than their FunC equivalents â€” they're **elegant**.  
No magic. No stack tricks. Just clean, consistent logic â€” whether it's a Jetton or a Wallet.

Take Jettons as an example. Compare these three files:

- a standard jetton config: [01/jetton_utils.tolk](contracts_Tolk/01_jetton/jetton-utils.tolk)
- Notcoin â€” supports masterchain: [03/jetton_utils.tolk](contracts_Tolk/03_notcoin/jetton-utils.tolk)
- tgBTC â€” supports sharding: [04/jetton_utils.tolk](contracts_Tolk/04_sharded_tgbtc/jetton-utils.tolk)

They are **remarkably similar**.  
Start with a simple Jetton. Want masterchain support? Add a line â€” and you have Notcoin.  
Want sharding? Set the desired `SHARD_DEPTH` â€” and you get a sharded Jetton.  
Message sending and address composition are encapsulated cleanly and declaratively.

And gas savings? They're a **consequence**.  
I didn't micro-optimize. Each contract was rewritten in about a day â€” just focusing on clarity.  
If the code is readable, it's probably already efficient.  
If the logic is hard to follow â€” that's where the inefficiency hides.

The compiler and stdlib will keep improving.  
But the core principle remains: **if you write code the way the language encourages â€” gas will take care of itself.**


## Correctness and test coverage

All Tolk contracts here **pass the same test suites** as their FunC originals.

In a few cases, tests were **slightly modified** â€” but only those that assert specific `exit codes`.

The reason: Tolk fails more gracefully on corrupted input. For example:
- FunC might crash with `exit code 9` ("cell underflow"),
- while Tolk returns `0xFFFF` ("invalid opcode").

So, I updated a few `expect(exit_code)` values â€” to match the actual (and now more meaningful) behavior.


## How to run and verify

```bash
npm run test:all
```

All tests are executed on Tolk contracts, using the same inputs as the original FunC versions.

The `bench-snapshots/` folder contains gas snapshots for each contract at different stages of rewriting.

You can also follow the Git history to see how each contract evolved â€” from raw auto-conversion to clean, idiomatic Tolk.


## Want to migrate your own contract from FunC to Tolk?

Start with the [FunC-to-Tolk converter](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/convert-func-to-tolk).  
It's a syntax-level tool that preserves 1:1 semantics â€” giving you a working Tolk version in "FunC-style," ready to be gradually modernized.

Then check out the guide [Tolk vs FunC](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/in-short).  
It focuses on syntax differences â€” but keep in mind: **Tolk is more than just new syntax**.
The language encourages a different mindset â€” one that puts data structures and types at the center, rather than imperative flow.
This philosophy isn't always spelled out in docs â€” but you'll feel it as you work with the code.

Use the contracts in this repository as a reference â€” especially the ones you're already familiar with.

Finally, Tolk is supported in blueprint. Run `npm create ton@latest`, and start experimenting!
